title: About Elm
---
Elm is a functional programming language that compiles to Javascript, written by Evan Czaplicki for the purpose of having a functional way to program Web UIs. You can see the tutorial for the Elm architecture at http://guide.elm-lang.org/, and download the core at https://github.com/elm-lang/core. Completing the tutorial grants a basic understanding of how Elm programs are constructed, as well as some of the more important features of Elm, like its view of model-view-controller, commands, subscriptions, and some basic UI creation. If you have a good understanding of functional languages, especially Haskell, Elm will be a fairly easy transition. For others, it will require a bit of a shift.
