I am a CS student at the University of Georgia with experience in the functional languages Elm and Erlang. This blog will be mostly focused on my experiences with Elm and functional programming.

### More Information
I've only been studying Elm and Erlang for a couple of weeks as of the time of the first post, so there will be gaps in my knowledge. I will be conservative in discussions about Elm structures that I'm not very sure about to avoid spreading misinformation.
